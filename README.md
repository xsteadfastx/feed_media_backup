`feed_media_backup` is a simple downloader of feed media. Some weeks ago i browsed my blog and found out that alot of media i linked and shared are no longer available. This is pretty bad for people browsing the blog or even found it through a web search. Its also frustrating if you use the blog as log for things you dont want to forget or appriciate.

With this little script you have the chance to backup it at least for yourself. Thanks to [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).
